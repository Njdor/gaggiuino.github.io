# Compatibility

Gaggiuino is designed for the Gaggia Classic family of espresso machines with 3-way valves (**NOT the Gaggia Classic V2, SIN035U RI9403**). Other espresso machines such as the Rancilio Silvia are also supported although no official installation instructions are available at this time.  
Gaggiuino is **not** designed for espresso machines that use a heat exchanger, thermoblock, thermocoil, group/check valve,  or rotary pump.

# Build Process

> [!TIP|style:callout|label:WHERE TO GO FOR HELP|iconVisibility:visible]
> If you need help (even during the planning phase) please make **one** [Discord](community/community-media.md#community-discord) help thread in [#install-help-gc](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/996814638471708683) (for Gaggia Classic) or [#install-help-gcp](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/996188987964268555) (for Gaggia Classic Pro/Eco/Evo).  
> Title the thread by *[username][machine type][control system] Thread Title* and include any links/pictures/videos that may apply to your question. As you have more questions, rename the *Thread Title* and add your question to the thread.  
> ***One help thread per person/machine, please!***

1. **Identify your espresso machine (or determine what to buy)**

  See the [Compatibility Table](#compatibility) and take note of any [Machine-Specific Instructions](guides/machine-specific-guide.md) that are mentioned there. 

2. **Determine your build path.** 

  Decide if you're going to order a [PCB](guides-stm32/pcb-guide.md) or build a [component (Lego)](guides-stm32/lego-component-build-guide.md) control system. PCBv4 is recommended for new Gen 3 builds, while PCBv3.1 is recommended for Gen 2 builds (see [Features](#features) and [Announcements](announcements/) to compare Gen 2 and Gen 3). The component build is slightly more flexible for experimentation and less picky about thermocouple grounding, however, it adds significant effort and makes reliability dependent on the maker's skill. 

  Decide how to integrate the control system with your espresso machine. It can either be [integrated into the stock wiring](guides-stm32/3pln-stock-wiring-integration.md) with a few jumpers (less wiring, but sometimes more confusing) or the stock wiring can be replaced with a [custom wiring harness](guides-stm32/3pln-custom-wiring.md) (more work, but results in a clean, straightforward install). It is recommended that you check the notes in the [Compatibility Table](#compatibility) for your machine and and read through the instructions before deciding.

  If you're building Gen 3, decide which interface option you prefer. Currently there is a 4.3" IPS [touchscreen](guides/interface-screen.md) (embedded and web UI) with 3 mounting options. A headless option (web UI only) is in development.

3. **Select and Order Components**

  Order components based on your machine and install path. Make sure to check the [Bill of Materials](#bill-of-materials), the [custom wiring page](guides-stm32/3pln-custom-wiring.md) (if that's the route you're going), and the pages of any optional accessories ([HW Scales](accessories/hw-scales.md), [ToFnLED](accessories/tofnled.md)) that you'd like to install. 

  There are approved official suppliers for PCBs and Kits, and 3D printed parts linked in the sidebar. Select the 3D print provider closest to you for the lowest shipping cost. Alternatively, the BOM has sources linked so you can order components yourself and 3D print from the design files.

  > [!TIP|style:callout|label:NAMING TIP|iconVisibility:visible]
  > There are two main groups of Gaggia Classic espresso machines referred to in the BOM and instructions:  
  >   - Gaggia Classic (GC)  
  >   - Gaggia Classic Pro (GCP), which generally includes the Pro, Eco, and Evo models

4. **Parts are in, time to build!**

  > [!WARNING|style:callout|label:WARNING ABOUT VIDEOS|iconVisibility:visible]
  > There are no official build videos. It is highly recommended to only follow the instructions on this website.

  Follow the instructions for your control system selection

    * [A: PCB](guides-stm32/pcb-guide.md)
    * [B: Component (Lego) build](guides-stm32/lego-component-build-guide.md)

  Follow the instructions for your wiring selection

    * [A: Stock Wiring Integration](guides-stm32/3pln-stock-wiring-integration.md)
    * [B: Custom Wiring Harness](guides-stm32/3pln-custom-wiring.md)

  Follow the instructions for your interface selection

    * [Interface: Screen](guides/interface-screen.md)

  Follow the instructions for any accessories that may have been selected

    * [HW Scales](accessories/hw-scales.md)
    * [ToFnLED](accessories/tofnled.md)

5. **Make Coffee!**

  Record your first start. Post this to [#first-start](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/919183771079692328) on Discord.  
  Record your first shot. Post this to [#first-shot](https://discord.com/channels/890339612441063494/910972035205857320) on Discord.  
  Read the [User Manual](learning/user-manual.md) for more information on the machine capabilities.

If you'd like to print the files yourself instead of purchasing from the official suppliers **please carefully review the recommended print parameters** on the design pages.

Additional Gaggiuino models can be found in the [Gaggiuino Model Collection](https://www.printables.com/social/340492-loogle/collections/265668) or on [Discord](community/community-media.md#community-discord) in the **#mod-3d-design-ideas** channel.

# Accessories

Accessories can be added to the base Gaggiuino build for additional features. BOM and instructions are linked below. 

* [Hardware Scales](accessories/hw-scales.md) sit below the drip tray and measure weight during shots. They're most useful for those who like to experiment with beans, grind, and profiles where predictive scales may have a difficult time
* [ToFnLED](accessories/tofnled.md) provides an RGB LED and sensor for measuring water tank level
